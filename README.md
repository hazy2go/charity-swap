## How it works

1. **You connect a wallet** — EVM, Solana, Sui, Injective, ICON, Stellar, or NEAR.
2. **You execute a cross-chain swap** through the SODAX intent solver.
3. **A 0.1% partner fee** (community-tunable) is deducted by the SDK and
   accrues to a **public wallet on Sonic** (`0x95A8…721AD`) — the address is
   shared, the balance is verifiable on the Sonic explorer, the math
   reconciles in this repo. Interim single-key wallet today; multisig to follow.
4. **You earn governance points** proportional to your swap volume.
5. **When the wallet hits a community-decided threshold**, a points-weighted
   vote opens to pick which charity from a curated shortlist receives the
   payout.
6. **The winning charity is paid out**, the cycle restarts.

---

## Why this exists

Two reasons:

1. **Prove SODAX is fast to build on.** The [SODAX Builders MCP](https://builders.sodax.com/mcp)
   means an AI agent (or a human with one open) can ship a real cross-chain
   dapp in an afternoon. This repo is the receipt.
2. **Send real money to charity, transparently.** Every swap on this app
   contributes. No skim. No "ops fee." The whole thing is open source,
   the wallet is public, the vote is on-the-record.

It's a two-week build in public. The community votes on the name, the
points system, the charity shortlist, the payout threshold, and the vote
duration. The code follows the community, not the other way round.

## The non-negotiables

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mainnet from day one** | No testnet diversion. Real wallets, real swaps, real fees. Test with the smallest amounts you can. |
| **100% of fees go to charity** | No protocol cut, no ops skim. If covering gas for fee claims is ever necessary, it goes to a public vote first. |
| **Open source, MIT** | What you see in this repo is what's running in production. |
| **Charity wallet publicly viewable** | Multisig on Sonic. Address disclosed in the UI. Balance verifiable in one click. |
| **Built in public** | Repo state matches what the community has been told. Every public milestone has a commit. |
| **No dark patterns in voting** | Whatever points-to-vote system the community picks gets implemented exactly. No silent "weighting" or "rounding." |

## Built with the SODAX Builders MCP

This whole repo was scaffolded against the
**[SODAX Builders MCP](https://builders.sodax.com/mcp)** — a Model Context
Protocol server that exposes:

- SDK documentation (searchable, fetchable page by page)
- Live config (supported chains, swap tokens, money market reserves)
- Partner-fee primitives
- Network and partner registries

I pointed Claude Code at it, asked for "a cross-chain swap component with
partner fees," and the entire wiring — provider tree, `useQuote`/`useSwap`
flow, allowance handling, the EVM connect button — fell out in an afternoon.

## What's live right now

**Day 11.** What works in this commit:

- ✅ Name: **Swaps without Borders** (community vote, Day 4)
- ✅ Multi-VM wallet connect via `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react` — EVM (Hana, MetaMask, Rabby, any EIP-6963) **plus** Solana, Sui, Injective, ICON, Stellar, NEAR
- ✅ **All 18 SODAX networks swappable** via a chain → token picker (~115 tokens); default ★ **Arbitrum USDC → Sonic SODA**
- ✅ Live quotes via `useQuote`; cross-ecosystem routing handled by the solver
- ✅ Allowance + approve flow via `useSwapAllowance` / `useSwapApprove` (native tokens skip approval)
- ✅ Real `useSwap` execution on mainnet
- ✅ **0.1% charity fee LIVE** → public Sonic wallet `0x95A8E0BcF616f7eF630b0D923667fbF52AA721AD` (interim EOA; 100% to charity)
- ✅ **Points ledger live** (Prisma + Supabase) — CoinGecko-priced, logged on every confirmed swap
- ✅ **`/leaderboard`** reading from Supabase · **`/charities`** 5-candidate shortlist
- ✅ **Vectorheart UI** — late-90s WipEout / The Designers Republic aesthetic (cyan + magenta + yellow on ink, Orbitron + JetBrains Mono + Barlow Condensed, type plates, slash dividers, diagonal corner cuts, hazard-tape ticker, mobile-aware)

What's intentionally **not** live yet:

- ❌ **Charity multisig** — interim single-key wallet today; migration is a one-line address change
- ❌ **Voting** — Day 10-11 once the community picks the rules (runs in Discord)
- ⚠️ **Non-EVM swap signing** — wired per the SDK and routes verified live, but not yet exercised with a real Solana/Sui/etc. wallet

---

## Run it locally

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# (optional) add NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID for WalletConnect
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

> ⚠️ **This is mainnet code.** The dev server hits real chains. Test with
> the smallest amounts you can — you're spending real gas.

## Decisions the community will make

These are kept as **env vars or DB rows** so they can flip without a code
change once the community votes:

| Project name | **Swaps without Borders** (decided Day 4 ✅) | Day 4 |
| Points-to-vote conversion | TBD | Day 4 |
| Charity shortlist | TBD | Day 8-10 |
| Payout threshold | TBD | Day 11 |
| Vote duration | TBD | Day 11 |
| Leaderboard public/private | TBD | Day 5 |
